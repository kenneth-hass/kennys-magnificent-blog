## Description

- My modivation for this project was to figure out how to use different functions to hold variables and edit them to get a grid to appear, a button to work and for information in the internal JS.
- I built this project to get a better ndestanding and build muscle memory for JavaScript.
- The problem it solves is finding a way to hold employee information and find the average salary of the employees.
- I learned how to use a the functions, where to place them in an order and how to call to variables.
